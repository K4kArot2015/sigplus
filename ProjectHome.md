sigplus Image Gallery Plus (or sigplus in short) is a straightforward way to add image or photo galleries to a Joomla template position, or to a Joomla article (content item) with a simple syntax. It takes a matter of minutes to set up a gallery but those who are looking for a powerful gallery solution will not be disappointed either: sigplus is suitable for both beginner and advanced users.

Even while simple to use, sigplus offers an impressive set of features. Images suitable for gallery preview are automatically generated with cropping and/or centering, and clicking on a preview image brings up a pop-up window overlay showing the original image without navigating away from the current page. Images in a gallery can be displayed in fixed or flow layout, they can be shown on a slider or carousel/rotator, or an image can blend into another using a fancy transition effect. Appearance and behavior are highly configurable including margin, border, padding, orientation (horizontal or vertical), animation speed, slideshow delay, image sort order, etc.

Despite its versatility, sigplus is completely free. It is a full-fledged product with all features included, there is no commercial professional version with extra features or paid club membership that grants you additional privileges. Since its publication in the [Joomla Extensions Directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/photos-a-images/photo-gallery/11426) in March 2010, sigplus has been rated the best extension in the _Photo gallery_ category.

Information you find on sigplus on these wiki pages applies to sigplus version 1.5, currently in development. For details on the latest stable version, see sigplus hosted in the [JED](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/photos-a-images/photo-gallery/11426).
